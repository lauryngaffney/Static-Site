	<p> Since ancient times, herbal medicine (botanical/phytomedicine) has been used by a multitude of cultures throughout
the world to aid in efficient bodily functions and easing illnesses. Although it is not a licensed profession in the United States,
 healthcare practitioners suggest a variety of administrations including extracts, tinctures, capsules, tablets and teas derived
from plant's seeds, berries, roots, leaves, bark, or flowers. Botanical healing is often paired with dietary modification, proper
exercise and methods of stress reduction to emphasize effectiveness. As herbs and spices are often paired with food, the ideal
that "food is medicine" is highly intertwined.
	</p>
<p> There are many papyrus writings from Chinese and Egyptian writings dating back as far as 3,000 BC.
Indigenous cultures such as African and Native American used herbaceous remedies as part of rituals and religious ceremonies,
whereas traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine strictly employed botanical therapies.
Across the cultures, researchers had found that each had tended to use the same or similar plants for the same purposes.
	</p>

	<p> In the early 19th century, when chemical analysis became available, scientists began to extract and modify ingredients
 from plants to conjure their own version of compounds. As this became widely employed, the use of herbal medicines declined in
favor of more potent pharmaceutical drugs. However, recently the WHO estimated that 80% of the worldwide populace rely on
herbacious medicine for primary health maintenance and due to the high inflation of pharmaceutical drugs, favor has started
returning back to the roots of organic medicine.

	<h4>Suggestions for Herb Sourcing</h4>

	<p> Do not buy dried whole herbs that have been jarred or put in containers at stores. Dried plants deteriorate upon exposure to air, light and moisture.
	The more finely chopped the plant parts are, the faster they die off.

	Avoid encapsulated powdered herbs, the oxidation causes them to deteriorate.

	The best herbal medicines are ones you grow yourself to ensure freshness and quality.

	If you are unable to grow your own,
	shop through reputable brands  that advertise honest purity of their ingredients.
	Look for herbal preparations that have been "wildcrafted" or cultivated organically.

	If it does not list the ingredients, do NOT buy it!
