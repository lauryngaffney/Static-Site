			Many people study herbalism on their own time and can claim to be herbalists without proper training.
			It is encouraged to consult a Traditional Chinese practitioner or Ayurvedic herbalist with extensive training and certifications.
			Both of these specialists rely on herbs for treatment and have a holistic approach for suggested healing.
			A great source for sifting through knowledgeable practitioners or naturopathic physicians (NDs or NMDs) can be found on the <a href="https://www.naturopathic.org/">
			American Association for Naturopathic Physicians.</a>
		</p>
		<p> 
			Naturopaths usually cannot prescribe pharmaceuticals as there are many training programs with varying forms of training.
			Not all have attended a prestigious 4 year program, so it is extremely important to do one's research when shopping for
			your wellness mentor. It is also imperative to keep in mind that the practitioners are typically not licensed to diagnose or treat diseases like MDs,
			but on the flip side, their formal education was unlikely to include a focus herbal medicinal practices like NDs.
